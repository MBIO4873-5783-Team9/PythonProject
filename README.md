# PythonProject
A repository of files and code used to generate the project on RNA-Seq analysis for MBIO 4873/5873 Python for Data Analytics.

To perform this analysis, please download the counts1.csv file from the Data Directory to your machine, alongside the Analysis Jupyter notebook. This should be all that is required to perform the necessary analysis.
The expected output in the significant_counts.csv can be generated by processing the sigs dataframe to a csv with Pandas sigs.to_csv("<name>").
The code should also contain automatic saving programs so that the plots you make are saved to your working.

Please contact Lane, Shawn, or Riley with any bugs or issues.
